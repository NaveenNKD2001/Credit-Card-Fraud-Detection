# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Due to digitilazation the number of online transactions are increased. Due to this the number of fraud transactions are also increasing. In this project, we are going to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether the transaction made using credit card is fraud or not.
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in september 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data, Features V1,....,V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features that are not transformed are 'Time' and 'amount'. Feature 'Time contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction.
